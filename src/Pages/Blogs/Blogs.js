                <h1><span className='gradient-text-2 text-2xl font-bold block my-4'>How does prototypical inheritance work?</span></h1>
                <p>Prototypal Inheritance is a feature of JavaScript that allows you to add methods and properties to objects. It is a system that allows one object to inherit another's characteristics and methods. A prototype usually acts as a template for additional objects, they extend the underlying object. We know that every object has an internal and a hidden property. These hidden properties help us to take our data and expand our data.</p>

                <h1><span className='gradient-text-2 text-2xl font-bold block my-4'>Why you do not set the state directly in React?</span></h1>
                <p>The state should not be used directly. Because
                    Our changes may be overwritten if we change it directly. Usually we state does not change immediately when we update the state directly. As a result, we will lose state control over all our elements. So Everybody Experienced developers say that donâ€™t do it.
